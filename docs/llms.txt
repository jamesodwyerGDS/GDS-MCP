This repository contains documentation for the Global Design System components, foundations, and patterns.

## Structure

- `/components/` - UI component documentation organized by atomic design principles
  - `/atoms/` - Basic building blocks (buttons, icons, inputs)
  - `/molecules/` - Combinations of atoms (search bars, form fields)
  - `/organisms/` - Complex UI sections (navigation, headers)
- `/foundations/` - Design tokens and fundamentals (colours, typography, spacing)
- `/patterns/` - Reusable design patterns (forms, layouts)

## Frontmatter Schema

All component documentation uses YAML frontmatter with these fields:
- name, description, category, status, version, updated
- tags, keywords, dependencies, relatedComponents
- tokens (colours, spacing, typography references)
- accessibility (wcagLevel, keyboardNavigable, ariaRoles)
- frameworks (React import paths)

## Usage

Documentation is optimized for LLM retrieval. Each section is self-contained (250-512 tokens) with key facts bolded for scanability.

## Framework

Primary cobe framework: React 
Primary vibe code framework: ShadCN + tailwind (used in Loveable, Figma Make)
