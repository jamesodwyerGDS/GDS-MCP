# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation, exploratory work, and legacy files that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference.

## Structure

### `/discoveries/`
Investigation and discovery documents created during development. These documents capture:
- Feature exploration and breakthrough findings
- Test results and validation work
- Implementation investigation notes
- API research and improvements

These files served their purpose during development but are not part of the active documentation workflow.

### `/metrics/`
Generated reports and analysis outputs that provide snapshots of the project at specific points in time.

### `/legacy/`
Previous implementations, original reference materials, and deprecated approaches.

## Why Archive?

Files are archived (rather than deleted) when they:
1. Contain valuable context about design decisions
2. Document exploratory work that may inform future development
3. Provide historical reference for how features were developed
4. Are no longer needed in the active workflow but may be useful for troubleshooting

## Accessing Archived Content

All archived files remain in git history and can be accessed at any time. The archive directory provides quick access without cluttering the main project structure.
