# Utility Components

These are useful components that are annoying to constantly recreate yourself.

## VisuallyHidden

`import { VisuallyHidden } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

Visually obvious actions (like an info button using an icon label) still need a text label for non-visual users. This component hides its content visually using CSS, leaving it available for screenreaders.

## IconButton

`import { IconButton } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

A mostly-unstyled button that centres its content and renders a focus outline. Intended to contain icons.

<Canvas of={iconButtonStories.Basic} sourceState="shown" />

## Stack

A box for spacing out children. It's easier to manage layout on a separate parent than to manually add margin to every child. The `gap` prop accepts spacing values from [`spacing`](?path=/docs/tokens-spacing--docs). It defaults to `"auditorium"`,

## UnstyledList

`import { UnstyledList, UnstyledListItem } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

We've been informed by Level Access that when lists do not have the default browser styling, VoiceOver does not treat them as lists. So that users relying on VoiceOver can still understand the structure of the page and navigate lists efficiently, you can use `UnstyledList` and `UnstyledListItem` instead of `ul` and `li`. This will add explicit ARIA `list` and `listitem` roles, overriding VoiceOver's default behaviour.
