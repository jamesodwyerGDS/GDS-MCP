# Badge

Importing the badge component in your project:

`import { Badge } from "@ticketmaster/global-design-system";`

<Primary />

<Controls of={stories.Basic} />

A `Badge` is a component used to provide information on new updates and notifications. It should be used with other components and cannot be used alone. A badge is available with or without an icon but always sits next to other text pieces. When used within other components, it can help draw a fan's attention to significant information that might be missed.

Use the props `textColor`, `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` and `icon` to style the badge as per design.

## textColor

Use the `textColor` prop with the color types `theme.text`, `theme.status` or any hardcoded value passed to it.

## backgroundColor

Use the `backgroundColor` prop with the color types `theme.base`, `theme.badge`, `theme.status` or any hardcoded value passed to it.

## borderColor

Use the `borderColor` prop with the color types `theme.base`, `theme.status` or any hardcoded value passed to it.

## icon

Use the `icon` prop to add an icon before the text in the badge.

## Examples

<Stories title="" />
