<ArgTypes of={AlertBoxLegacy} />

## Standard

<Canvas of={stories.Basic} />

<Canvas of={stories.WithChildren} />

<Canvas of={stories.WithCustomChildren} />

## Variants

The `variant` prop sets the colour/icon variant of the alert box. You can choose from `info` (default), `warning`, `success` and `danger`. This has no real semantic value - it just sets the colour and changes the icon. Make sure your messages have appropriate text to convey the severity.

<Canvas of={stories.WithChildren} />

<Canvas of={stories.Warning} />

<Canvas of={stories.Success} />

<Canvas of={stories.Danger} />

## Sizes

The `size` prop allows you to set the AlertBox to be a bit smaller and take up less vertical space. All it does is reduce the vertical padding on the two containers. There are currently only two options: `moderate` and `normal`, which reflect the sizes in the [`spacing` object](/spacing):

<Canvas of={stories.ModerateTitleOnly} />

<Canvas of={stories.Moderate} />

## Dismissable

In some cases, you might want the user to be able to dismiss the alert after seeing it. This can be achieved with the `dismissable` prop. Don't forget to add the `onDismiss` function and the `dismissLabel` for accessibility (otherwise just the cross icon renders without any helpful text for a screenreader).

<Canvas of={stories.DismissableWarning} />

<Canvas of={stories.DismissableDanger} />
