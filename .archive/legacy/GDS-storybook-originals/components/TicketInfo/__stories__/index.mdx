<ArgTypes of={TicketInfo} />

The `title` prop can be a string, or a React node, meaning you can put just about anything in there. This means we can create fancy title components on the consumer side and push them in to the `TicketInfo` shell. For example:

<Canvas of={stories.WithTitle} />

The `customSeatInfo` prop was added to allow us to override the standard (and to be deprecated) injection of the SeatInfo component via its associated props. Primarily, it allows us to override the seat information block with something completely custom. The most common use case is to make changes if the seat is general admission, which was, historically, a pain because it meant passing even more props to the SeatInfo component.
