# Stepper

`import { Stepper } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

<Primary />

<ArgTypes of={Stepper} />

## Primary variant

By default, the component has the `primary` variant.

<Canvas of={stories.Basic} />

## Primary variant (disabled)

You can set the component to be completely **_disabled_** by setting the `disabled` prop to `true`.

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledPrimary} />

## Secondary variant

You can define the variant to be `secondary` by passing the `variant` prop.

<Canvas of={stories.Secondary} />

## Secondary variant (disabled)

You can set the component to be completely **_disabled_** by setting the `disabled` prop to `true`.

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledSecondary} />

## Controlled component

You can control the state of this component yourself by passing `value` and `onChange` props.

## Accessibility

A [spinbutton](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/) is an input widget that restricts its value to a set or range of discrete values.

Spinbuttons often have three components, including a text field that displays the current value, an increase button, and a decrease button. The text field is usually the only focusable component because the increase and decrease functions are keyboard accessible via arrow keys.

### Keyboard Interaction

When a spinbutton receives focus, it should be placed on the spinbutton itself. The up and down arrows on a keyboard perform the increment and decrement functions. The increment and decrement button elements are NOT included in the primary navigation ring, _(e.g., the **Tab** ring in HTML)_.

- `Up Arrow`: Increases the value.
- `Down Arrow`: Decreases the value.
- `Home`: If the spinbutton has a minimum value, sets the value to its minimum.
- `End`: If the spinbutton has a maximum value, sets the value to its maximum.

### Screen Readers

Assistive technologies present `aria-valuenow` as numeric values, and sometimes numeric values are announced as percentage values. For example, if a spinbutton has the options `[1,2,3,4]` and the option `2` is selected, the screen reader might announced **"fifty percent"**. This may not always be clear or helpful to the users. The attribute `aria-valuetext` provides a way of presenting the current value as a string, in a more user-friendly representation of the value.

### Disabled

If the Stepper component is disabled, the focus should still be placed on the spinbutton and screen readers should be able to read the value, even if it can't be changed.
