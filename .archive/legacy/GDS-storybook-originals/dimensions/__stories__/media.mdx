# Media queries

`import { media } from "@ticketmaster/global-design-system";`

## Available breakpoints

```js
export const media = {
  small: "min-width: 512px",
  medium: "min-width: 1024px",
  large: "min-width: 1680px",
};
```

The individual breakpoints are also exported as `px` values:

```js
export const breakpoints = {
  small: "512px",
  medium: "1024px",
  large: "1680px",
};
```

TM designers should create layouts for **four primary viewport sizes**:

<img src={viewports} alt="Viewports diagram" />

However, these can be extended by individual projects if other breakpoints are needed in-between.

## Example

For example, if a container needs to be narrower on desktop screens, you can set a media query as follows:

```jsx
import { media } from "@ticketmaster/global-design-system";

export const Container = styled.div`
  width: 95%;

  @media (${media.medium}) {
    width: 75%;
  }
`;
```

## Use in GDS components

Most GDS components are **designed to fill 100% of whatever container they are in**. This allows them to **adapt fluidly and scale naturally** as the layout resizes, and **avoids hardcoding sizes** that might break this responsiveness.
But in rare cases, media queries are used to ensure correct responsive behaviour.
