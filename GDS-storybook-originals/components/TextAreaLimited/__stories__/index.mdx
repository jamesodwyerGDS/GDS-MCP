# TextAreaLimited

`import { TextAreaLimited } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

<Primary />

<ArgTypes of={TextAreaLimited} />

## Usage

The **TextAreaLimited** component is made for forms where you want to limit multi-line input to a certain number of characters.
It does not restrict a user from entering more than the provided `characterLimit`, but instead displays a message with the number of characters remaining or over the limit.
Validation to restrict form submission needs to be handled by the consuming app.

<Canvas of={stories.Basic} />

## CharacterLimit hint text

As GDS does not deal with translation of text, the functionality to render the hint text must be provided by the consuming app.
The `renderCharacterLimit` prop allows flexible display of the character limit.
You can use a function which returns anything from a string to a fully styled component.

<Canvas of={stories.TranslatedCharacterLimit} />

<Canvas of={stories.StyledCharacterLimit} />

If the `renderCharacterLimit` prop is not supplied, only the `characterLimit` number will be displayed by default.

<Canvas of={stories.NoRenderCharacterLimit} />

Passing the `disabled` prop to the component will make the textarea unusable and un-clickable. The textarea will also be ignored by most screen readers.

N.B. If the textarea is disabled, the CharacterCounter will not be displayed.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

The component can be passed the `readOnly` prop that is visually identical to the `disabled` prop except it can be read out by a screen reader as just text. Useful in cases where you would need to disable the textarea but still want the value to be read out.

<Canvas of={stories.ReadOnly} />
