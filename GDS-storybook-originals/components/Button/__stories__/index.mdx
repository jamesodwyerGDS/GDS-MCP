# Button

Importing the button component in your project:

```js
import { Button } from "@ticketmaster/global-design-system";
```

<Primary />

<ArgTypes of={Button} />

## Color variants

The `colorVariant` prop defines what color from the theme we should use. Valid values are:

### `primary` - default

<Canvas of={stories.Basic} />

### `secondary`

Always forced to `outline` fill variant

<Canvas of={stories.Secondary} />

### `tertiary`

Always forced to `outline` fill variant

<Canvas of={stories.Tertiary} />

### `transaction`

<Canvas of={stories.Transaction} />

### `disabled`

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### `inverse`

Always forced to `outline` fill variant

<DarkCanvas>
  <Story of={stories.Inverse} />
  <Story of={stories.InverseDisabled} />
</DarkCanvas>

## Full width buttons

The `fullWidth` prop allows the button to stretch to fit its container.

<Canvas of={stories.FullWidth} />

## Outline button

The `fillVariant` prop defines how we fill the button. Valid values are `fill`, `outline` and `ghost`. It can be used in combination with the `colorVariant` to change its appearance.

`secondary`, `tertiary` and `inverse` color variants will force the `fillVariant` to `outline` since this is how they are defined in the designs. See the designs on figma [here](<https://www.figma.com/file/WU01oSRfSHpOxUn3ThcvC5/(New)-Marketplace-Global-Design-System?node-id=30-22984&t=NSxbgyfqkhnboZ9R-0>) or see the color variant examples above for how they look.

Other colors like `transaction` can be made into outline buttons with the `outline` fill variant.

<Canvas of={stories.Outline} />

Note: The `primary` color variant with `outline` is almost identical to the `secondary` color variant, so it might be best to avoid using that combination and use `secondary` instead.

## Ghost button

Once again, use the `ghost` `fillVariant` prop to create Ghost buttons.

<Canvas of={stories.Ghost} />

## Loading

To display a loading spinner in the button, eg to provide user feedback during asynchronous actions such as form submission or API calls,
you can provide a `loading` object prop to the button.

This includes an `isLoading` boolean prop, and mandatory `hiddenLoadingMessage` string. This message is assertively read out by assistive technology when the loading state is triggered.
This should be a descriptive message like "Form is submitting...".

<Canvas of={stories.Loading} />

## With Icons

Use the `startIcon` and `endIcon` props to render icons inside the button. They should both be React nodes.

<Canvas of={stories.WithStartIcon} />

<Canvas of={stories.WithEndIcon} />

Icon sizes can be adjusted to suit. By default they are `1em` but can be tweaked individually with the `size` prop on the icon. They can also be rotated if required:

<Canvas of={stories.WithBigIcon} />
<Canvas of={stories.WithRotatedIcon} />
<Canvas of={stories.WithSmallIcon} />

## Submit

When the element is used as `submit` button.

<Canvas of={stories.Submit} />

## As links

The element that a button component renders may occasionally need to be an `<a>` instead of a `<button>`.
Use the `as="a"` or `as={CustomLinkComponent}` prop for this, and make sure to include an `href`.

<Canvas of={stories.Link} />

### Disabled links

Use `aria-disabled="true"` prop instead of `disabled` to set and style the link as disabled. `aria-disabled="true"` will also automatically assign `undefined` to `href`, preventing any interactions with it:

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledLink} />

## With a right chevron

A common use-case for the buttons is to include a right-chevron on the right hand side (usually to denote the user will "go somewhere" rather than just trigger an action). This is usually coupled with the button being an `<a>`. There is a shortcut prop for this so we don't need to import and declare the icon specifically each time; the `hasChevron` prop.

Additionally, as seen on the first example, if you have the `hasChevron` prop set, it will override anything set via the `endIcon` prop.

<Canvas of={stories.WithChevron} />

The button doesn't have to be an `<a>` for this to work:

## Accessibility

### WCAG Success Criterion

> 3.2.2 On Input: Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component.

### Disabled Button

The general recommendation is to avoid using disabled buttons unless there’s a good reason to.
Disabled buttons can create usability challenges and hinder user experience. Instead, it's best to design a user experience that guides users to achieve the desired action, promoting better accessibility and inclusivity.

#### When to Use Disabled Buttons

There are specific scenarios where using disabled buttons or links may be necessary to clarify or prevent users from taking inappropriate actions. Some examples include:

- In `PageButtons` component, disable the "previous page" link when the user is on the first page to indicate that there's no previous page available.
- In `Calendar` events, disabling days with no events to help keyboard-only and assistive technology users skip them and navigate available events effectively.

#### How to use Disabled Links

When we need a disabled link we use `aria-disabled="true"` prop, instead of `disabled` avaialable only for `<button>` and not for `<a>`.

<img
  src={PageButtonsDisabled}
  alt="Disabled Link in the pagination component"
/>
Image caption: `PageButtons` with disabled links.

<img
  src={CalendarButtonsDisabled}
  alt="Disabled Buttons used for days without events in the calendar component"
/>
Image caption: `Calendar` component with disabled day buttons.

#### Ensuring Perceivability and User Guidance

When using disabled buttons, it's crucial to ensure all users can perceive their disabled state.
Providing clear visual cues, appropriate text labels, or ARIA attributes for assistive technologies can help convey the button's status effectively. Additionally, include instructions or contextual information to inform users about the actions they need to take to activate the button when appropriate. E.g. [AlertBox](http://global-design-system.git.tmaws.io/gds/?path=/docs/components-alertbox--docs).

Please follow the recommendations listed in [Making Disabled Buttons More Inclusive](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/frustrating-design-patterns-disabled-buttons/#making-disabled-buttons-more-inclusive)

#### Meeting Other Accessibility Criteria

While disabled buttons are not required to meet colour contrast standards, it's crucial to maintain adequate contrast for other active elements on the page.

Refer to [WCAG Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#:~:text=Incidental,interface%20component%2C) for more information.
