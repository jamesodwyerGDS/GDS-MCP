# PaginationButton

`import { PaginationButton } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

<Primary />

<ArgTypes of={PaginationButton} />

## Basic Use:

Most of the props should be pretty self explanatory, but note that the `total` and `count` props are only used to help render the progress bar.

The `Showing XX out of YYY events` text is provided as the `recapLabel` prop and could in theory be anything. We do this to allow us to use external translations for different markets.

## Examples:

Normal use:

<Canvas of={stories.Basic} />

On inverse backgrounds:

<DarkCanvas centered>
  <Story of={stories.Inverse} />
</DarkCanvas>

This button can also be used to scroll to the top of an events list after pagination is complete

<Canvas of={stories.ReverseExample} />

Since the type of `recapLabel` is `ReactNode` it can either be a string, or JSX to add formatting (i.e. making the numbers bold). Please keep any JSX simple to avoid things looking too weird.

<Canvas of={stories.BadExample} />
