# SuccessMessage

`import { SuccessMessage } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

<Primary />

<ArgTypes of={SuccessMessage} />

## Usage

This component is primarily used for input validation. It is already used in the `InputField` component and therefore most input components by default when the `SuccessMessage` prop is used.
However, for example, in cases where more than one is needed, it can be added manually:

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleMessages} />
