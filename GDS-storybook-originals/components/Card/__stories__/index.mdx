import { Meta, Canvas } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";
import Card from "..";
import * as stories from "./index.stories";

<Meta title="Components/Card" component={Card} />

# Card

`import { Card } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

{/* Can't get argTypes because it's a compound component :/ */}

## Usage

`Card` is a compound component for putting things in a box with a shadow.

<Canvas of={stories.TitleOnly} />

<Canvas of={stories.Basic} />

You can build more complex components by composing layouts yourself:

<Canvas of={stories.Complex} sourceState="shown" />
