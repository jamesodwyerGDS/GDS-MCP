# Skeleton

`import { Skeleton } from '@ticketmaster/global-design-system';`

<Primary />

<ArgTypes of={Skeleton} />

## Usage

The Skeleton component provides a visual placeholder for loading content that we know the shape of.
It is ideal for pages which require longer load times, giving users an indication that something is happening behind the scenes, and preventing layout shift.

By default, it takes up the full width of the parent container and has `25px` height.
These can be adjusted by passing valid dimension values to the `width` and `height` props:

<Canvas of={stories.WithSetDimensions} sourceState="shown" />

Multiple Skeleton elements should be used to mimic the actual layout of the content we are waiting for:

<Canvas of={stories.Multiple} sourceState="shown" />

### Note

If the structure of the data we are loading is unknown, consider using a [LoadingSpinner](?path=/docs/components-loadingspinner--docs) instead.

## Accessibility considerations

- This component has no content, and so is not read out by assistive technology by default. So it is important for you to provide meaningful context for screen reader users.
  We should indicate to screen readers that an element is in a loading state using a `VisuallyHidden` span. See example above.
- For users who prefer reduced motion, all animation should be removed from the Skeleton with a [prefers-reduced-motion media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion). This is helpfully handled in `getGlobalStyles`.
